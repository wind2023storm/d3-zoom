## API Reference

This table describes how the zoom behavior interprets native events:

| Event        | Listening Element | Zoom Event | Default Prevented? |
| ------------ | ----------------- | ---------- | ------------------ |
| mousedown⁵   | selection         | start      | no¹                |
| mousemove²   | window¹           | zoom       | yes                |
| mouseup²     | window¹           | end        | yes                |
| dragstart²   | window            | -          | yes                |
| selectstart² | window            | -          | yes                |
| click³       | window            | -          | yes                |
| dblclick     | selection         | zoom⁶      | yes                |
| wheel        | selection         | zoom⁷      | yes                |
| touchstart   | selection         | start⁶     | no⁴                |
| touchmove    | selection         | zoom       | yes                |
| touchend     | selection         | end        | no⁴                |
| touchcancel  | selection         | end        | no⁴                |

The propagation of all consumed events is [immediately stopped](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-event-stopimmediatepropagation).

¹ Necessary to capture events outside an iframe; see [d3-drag#9](https://github.com/d3/d3-drag/issues/9).
<br>² Only applies during an active, mouse-based gesture; see [d3-drag#9](https://github.com/d3/d3-drag/issues/9).
<br>³ Only applies immediately after a non-empty, mouse-based gesture.
<br>⁴ Necessary to allow [click emulation](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/HandlingEvents/HandlingEvents.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006511-SW7) on touch input; see [d3-drag#9](https://github.com/d3/d3-drag/issues/9).
<br>⁵ Ignored if within 500ms of a touch gesture ending; assumes [click emulation](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/HandlingEvents/HandlingEvents.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006511-SW7).
<br>⁶ Double-click and double-tap initiate a transition that emits start, zoom and end events.
<br>⁷ The first wheel event emits a start event; an end event is emitted when no wheel events are received for 150ms.
